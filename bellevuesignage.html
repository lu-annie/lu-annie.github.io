								<h3>Context</h3>
						Motivated by the desire to improve parks and other public facilities, our team decided to choose the City of Bellevue as our sponsor for this project. The City of Bellevue Parks and Community Services Department manages 2,700 acres of land ‚Äì
						including an extensive network of 80 miles of trails. While the department provides language
						translation and interpretation as specified in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, it is aiming to
						improve its signage and reassess its accessibility per Title VI and ADA standards. <br><br>
						Exisiting signs were text-heavy, poorly placed, and not frequently interacted with. Feedback indicated the need for clearer
						
						directions, trail difficulty markers, maps, and better use of symbology for language accessibility.
						Our initial redesigned park signage prototypes included using clear fonts, type hierarchy, clear
						color contrast, and consistent symbology. These initial designs were then compared to current
						park signage to better understand visitor preference and receive diverse feedback. Both the final
						redesigned park signage prototypes and overall research findings aim to define criteria and goals
						which can make City of Bellevue‚Äôs park signage more accessible, safe, and enjoyable for all
						visitors.<br><br>
						This project aims to evaluate the accessibility of current park signage and identified
						effective ways to improve signage accessibility. Our work was guided by the research question:
						How might we improve the accessibility of signage for the City of Bellevue?
						<br>

						<h3>The Process</h3>
						I worked on a team with 3 other HCDE undergraduate students. We created these final deliverables to present at the HCDE capstone showcase (my specific roles for this project are emphasized above).
						<br><br>
