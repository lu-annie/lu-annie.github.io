							<h3>Problem</h3>
								Many individuals and communities have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically experiencing food, housing, and unemployment hardships. While there are many non-profit organizations, companies, and general volunteers, there is still a need for a tool to connect to those in need to provide better accessibility to food/daily necessities and create a network of volunteers.
							</br>
							</br>
						<h3>Our Solution</h3>
									In order to address these issues, we created <i>giV.</i>, a singular platform that allows users to post and search for volunteering opportunities with organizations, connect as a community, and have the ability to volunteer for quick, easy, non-long-term opportunities without the inconvenience of creating an account.
							</br>
						</br>

								<h3>Challenges</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>COVID-19 Pandemic created new concerns for volunteering in person</li>
									<li>Users want opportunities to volunteer yet don't like the inconvenience of registering an account</li>
									<li>Current volunteering sites have busy user interfaces that may be confusing for some</li>
								  </ul>
							</div>
							<div class="column2">
								<h3>Goals</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Inform users of nearby (limited travel) volunteering opportunities and implement other COVID-19 safety advice for volunteers </li>
									<li>Allow filters for users to easily find volunteering opportunties based off their own interests and convenience</li>
									<li>Build a user interface that allow users to be able to track, organize and manage their opportunities directly from their profile</li>
								  </ul>

						<h3>The Process</h3>
						This part is currently under construction. <a href="https://daphanieddchan.wixsite.com/givhcde/our-process" target="_blank"><u>Link to Website</u></a>

						<h3>What I Learned</h3>
						As this project was my first ever case study, I learned the basics of how to use Figma, design a user interface, carry out the entire design process, and collaborate with a team. Since it was a first iteration, many parts of our design could've used some refining (for starters - including a design system). User testing for our final prototype also was not done, so we unfortunately couldn't determine how effective our website was for volunteers. <br>
						<br>
						However, I am satisfied with how well our team coordinated the work and tasks assigned, as we did not face any large disagreements in carrying out our ideas. This was a great first learning experience, and if we were to work together again, our team would refine our prototype to be better targetted toward real volunteers, as well as include some metrics to determine the effectiveness of our site, <i>giV.</i>, in achieving the intended design goals.
