							<h3>Problem</h3>
								Many individuals and communities have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically experiencing food, housing, and unemployment hardships. While there are many non-profit organizations, companies, and general volunteers, there is still a need for a tool to connect to those in need to provide better accessibility to food/daily necessities and create a network of volunteers.
							</br>
							</br>
						<h3>Our Solution</h3>
									In order to address these issues, we created <i>giV.</i>, a singular platform that allows users to post and search for volunteering opportunities with organizations, connect as a community, and have the ability to volunteer for quick, easy, non-long-term opportunities without the inconvenience of creating an account.

								<h3>Challenges</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>COVID-19 Pandemic created new concerns for volunteering in person</li>
									<li>Users want opportunities to volunteer yet don't like the inconvenience of registering an account</li>
									<li>Current volunteering sites have busy user interfaces that may be confusing for some</li>
								  </ul>
							</div>
							<div class="column2">
								<h3>Goals</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Inform users of nearby (limited travel) volunteering opportunities and implement other COVID-19 safety advice for volunteers </li>
									<li>Allow filters for users to easily find volunteering opportunties based off their own interests and convenience</li>
									<li>Build a user interface that allow users to be able to track, organize and manage their opportunities directly from their profile</li>

						<h3>The Process</h3>
						"The topic we will be focusing on is <i>Back to the Future</i>, designing for life after the pandemic." <br>
						<br>
						That was a general idea of the prompt that I remembered. As it was the beginning of 2022, 2 years after the first outbreak of the coronavirus, our team was tasked with creating a design that must benefit people navigating life after the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic meant we had to think about previous actions we wouldn't have thought twice about with a new sense of safety. <br>
						<br>
						This led to a group brainstorming session in which we came up with ideas. We decided to focus on the realm of volunteering, as that was greatly affected by the pandemic. Social distancing, masks, and other protective measures meant volunteering wouldn't be easy. Many people were hesitant to leave their own homes during this time. We wanted to ease volunteers back into their opportunities, but without the commitment, so we came up with <i>giV.</i>, a website dedicated to providing volunteers with opportunities that allowed them to choose opportunities they were interested in, on their own convenient terms.<br>
						<br>
						We begun with the most important aspect: research. This involved competitive product analysis, interviews with potential users, and creation of personas/user journey maps/storyboards from that research. Each of us did our own set of research and collaborated to find similarities and differences in what we found.<br><br>
												From there, we listed out our product design requirements and created task flows and information architecture, which would guide our lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes.<br><br>
												After our lo-fi prototype was completed, we each tested it with one user (for a total of 4 tests) in order to determine which areas needed fixing. Then, we went onto creating annotated wireframes and the hi-fi prototype with these insights in mind.<br><br>
												We evaluated strengths and weaknesses in our website design. We found that we have a few areas to fix which are detailed in the section after.<br><br>

						The link to our full design process can be found below. Work samples are also on the website. <br>

						<h3>What I Learned</h3>
						As this project was our first ever case study, I learned the basics of how to use Figma, design a user interface, carry out the entire design process, and collaborate with a team. Since it was a first iteration, many parts of our design could've used some refining (for starters - including a design system). User testing for our final prototype also was not done, so we unfortunately couldn't determine how effective our website was for volunteers. <br>
						<br>
						However, I am satisfied with how well our team coordinated the work and tasks assigned, as we did not face any large disagreements in carrying out our ideas. This was a great first learning experience, and if we were to work together again, our team would refine our prototype to be better targetted toward real volunteers, as well as include some metrics to determine the effectiveness of our site, <i>giV.</i>, in achieving the intended design goals.
