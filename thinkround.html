							<h3>About Think Round Inc.</h3>
							<u><a href="https://www.thinkround.org/the-center-for-the-human-family" target="_blank">Think Round Inc.</a></u> is a dynamic non-profit organization with a rich history, co-founded by the visionary designer and social entrepreneur, Dr. Sophia Reynolds, and renowned artist and community advocate, Heidi Hardin. Driven by their unwavering commitment to creativity, empathy, and social responsibility, they established Think Round Inc. as a platform for addressing complex societal challenges through human-centered design and artistry.
<br><br>
For the duration of this internship, I worked under Heidi Hardin. Heidi is an accomplished artist known for her powerful community art projects, brings a unique perspective to Think Round Inc. Her passion for using art as a means of social engagement and transformation has been instrumental in shaping the organization's mission and projects. Her artistry and community-building expertise have played a pivotal role in fostering collaboration, inclusivity, and sustainability in every facet of Think Round Inc.'s work.
<br><br>
Under the co-founder's visionary leadership, Think Round Inc. has become a driving force for innovation in the non-profit sector, embodying their values and vision in every project they undertake. With the combined expertise of Dr. Sophia Reynolds and Heidi Hardin, the organization continues to make a significant impact, pushing the boundaries of what's possible through human-centered design and community-driven art initiatives.

						<h3>The Process</h3>
						During one of our first meetings, Heidi Hardin told me her ideal vision for the Center for the Human Family was to connect cultures around the world, sharing our experiences, listening to theirs, indulging in their arts, and having them indulge in ours, as there is so much to appreciate from people different to our own. In a world that is highly focused on fighting differences rather than finding similarities, I found this to be very inspiring motive that aligned with mine, so I used her motivations to design a series of areas in the Virtual Center for the Human Family that aimed to connect people around the world instead of bringing them apart.
						<br><br>
						I designed three flows within the Virtual Center for the Human Family: the Restaurant, the Cafe, and the Gallery. Our roles were divided by floors, and I was assigned to the First Floor, which included areas (beyond what I worked on) such as the Lobby, Aquaponics Garden, Culinary Academy. During the internship, I collaborated with a UX team of two/three other people, creating wireframes, prototyping flows, and making edits (such as adhering to best UI practices) as suggested by our design lead and other designers. I also collaborated with software developers to ensure our designs were feasible for implementation, along with Heidi herself to get ideas for designing new spaces.
						<br><br>
						<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
						Part of my work involved brainstorming in order to figure out what in include in these three exhibits. I began by hopping on a call with Heidi to discuss her ideas for the restaurant and cafe first.
						<br></br>

						Then we talked about the Zoom call concept for the restaurant. <br><br>

						<br><br>
						<h3>1. Restaurant</h3>
						The first exhibit was the restaurant.

						<h3>2. Cafe</h3>
						The next exhibit was the cafe, that was connected to the restaurant.<br></br>
						<img src="/thinkroundimages/cafe_flow.png" alt="brainstorm" width="50%"/><br></br>
						Similar in flow to the cafe, below is what the cafe at the Center of the Human Family looks like. <br><br>
