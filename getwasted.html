								<h3>Problem</h3>
								In 2018, the U.S. produced <a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials" target="_blank"><u>292.4 million tons of trash in 2018</u></a>, almost tripling the amount produced in 1960. That's about 4.9 pounds of trash per person, per day. The trash collects in landfills, harming our environment, oceans, wildlife, and quality of living. This opens up the question of how we can prevent more damage to our ecosystem in the realm of sustainability.
							</br>
							</br>
						<h3>Our Solution</h3>
									While we can't get rid of all sources of trash, we can choose an area to focus on replacing with sustainable techniques. We created <i>Get Wasted</i>, a non-profit organization that aims to promote sustainable fabrication techniques among makers and non-makers alike. We did this in the form of a website that aims to encourage people to explore the concept of upcycling - making something new out of something that would've been otherwise thrown away, effectively keeping trash out of landfills.

										<h3>Challenges</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Lack of community among makers</li>
											<li>Difficulty sourcing materials (price, no areas to recycle/donate, not having specifics)</li>
											<li>People who are not into the makers' community are not sure where and how to begin</li>

										<h3>Goals</h3>
										  <ul>
											<li>Give users access to upcycling inspiration</li>
											<li>Help users find a sense of community such as by connecting them with other makers</li>

								<h3>The Process</h3>
								Motivated by a desire to live more sustainably, I decided to take part in a design project in the new year. Under the support of our project leader, in the span of 6 months, our team of 6 members managed to turn an idea for a sustainable fabrication non-profit into a design-come-true. <br><br>
								<h3>1. Problem Statement</h3>
						While we wanted to design a sustainable solution, we needed to focus in on a specific area. As makers, our team identified three main issues within the realm of fabrication: lack of community, difficulties sourcing materials, and beginners not being sure where to begin. That's where we came up with the design question: <br>
							</br><i>How might we provide makers with the ability to connect to other makers for the purpose of reducing waste, building community, and providing a dedicated space to share materials and ideas?</i>
						<br></br>
						<h3>2. Primary/Secondary Research</h3>	
						We began by conducting research, in multiple realms. Our secondary research started with us studying 4 domains related to upcycling: environmental impacts, community building, personal and social benefits, and existing platforms. From there, we summarized relevant research, created interview questions, and began finding people to interview. <br><br>

						<img src="/portfolio case study images/dfa_research2.png" alt="dfa_research2" width="49%"/>
						<br></br>
						For our primary research, we created personas and picked out a user group: makers who wanted to learn about ways to upcycle. We chose 4 people who had varying degrees of skill in fabrication (and use of upcycled materials) to interview. From the interview transcripts, we conducted an affinity analysis to find similarities within their responses.<br><br>

						<br></br>
						<h3>3. Ideation </h3>
						After organizing our interview insights, we needed to come up with a solution to address makers' desires. We conducted competitive analyses of over non-profit and upcycling-related organizations. Focused on creating long-lasting community over tangible products, we ultimately deciding on building a non-profit organization to educate users on fabrication with upcycled materials. From there, we created an information architecture and visual guides in order to prompt ideas for our website design. <br></br>

						<img src="/portfolio case study images/dfa_visuals.png" alt="dfa_visuals" width="33%"/>
						<br></br>
						<h3>4. Prototyping</h3>
						We created a preliminary lo-fi prototype through Figma, which would guide our hi-fi prototype. The lo-fi prototype involved basic placement of images, text boxes, buttons, etc. The hi-fi prototype is where we would refine our color palette and graphics in order to create a website with good visual design and match our organization's theme. We used principles of current website UI design trends of non-profit websites in order to adhere to users' intuitive navigation tendencies.<br><br>

						<br></br>

						<h3>5. Fabrication</h3>
						We finished up by having each group member create an item to really showcase the world of sustainable fabrication. I'd sewn a tote bag out of recycled shirts that would've been donated otherwise.<br></br>
